# Practices
## Project Creation
1. Save all projects in the root folder
1. If multiple projects work together, name them in a manner that reflects this. For example:
	1. CoastalShipping.AngularClient
	2. CoastalShipping.Api
	3. CoastalShipping.DAL
1. Group projects together using the logical stucture of Solution Folders. [How to create a solution folder](http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/VSSolutionFolders.aspx)
1. For each project, please also create an overview and link it to this page. you can link pages as below
